# Stream
Place this app in **nextcloud/apps/**

Adds Stream option to the right click menu on all audio and video files.

Inspired from how "Stream" works on the Nextcloud Android App, by creating a 24h link and in this case I also pack it in a playlist and "open" it.
The reason for packing it in a playlist is to get the same behaviour as the app, to call a media player and play it back instead of trying to download it.
The link created also allows for searching in the media.
